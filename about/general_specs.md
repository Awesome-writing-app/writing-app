# Cookie Cat Markdown Editor
An editor to write markdown documents

This spec is in-progress and not at all complete.

## Features

- Markdown (Github flavor, with syntax highlighting?)
- Saves documents in plain text so that they can be edited by other editors
    - Tags and metadata must be saved within the file
    - These tags/metadata must be user-readable- there's no point saving them this way otherwise
- Pretty
